# Ball tracking in volleyball

This repo is for ball recognition and tracking in live volleyball game.

## Requirements
- Python3
- OpenCV
- Keras with Tensorflow

## How to use

1. Get a video file with a game fragment
2. Get highest blobs:

*python3 high.py <path_to_vb_file> <mask_output_dir> <color_output_dir>*

3. Classify manually the blobs into 2 classes (b)all/(n)ot ball
4. Put the classified data into ball-net/train
5. cd ball-net
6. Python3 train.py
7. Test blobber: 

*python3 blobber.py <path_to_vb_file> 

You will see and output with ball paths like that:

8. Run a player with the live ball tracking:

*python3 ball_play.py <path_to_vb_file>
